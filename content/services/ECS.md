## ECS Features
- ECS Instance
	- Instances are deregistered
		- Manually if the instance in the `STOPPED` state.
		- Automatically if the instance is the `RUNNING` state.
- ECS Roles
	- Container instance role
		- Allows ECS container agent running in instances to call ECS API on our behalf. It attaches ` ecsInstanceRole` #role
	- Task execution role [ðŸ”—](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html)â€¬
	- Task role [ðŸ”—](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
- Tasks
	- Parameters which are defined in a task:
		- Docker image to use with each container in a task.
		- CPU and memory allocation
		- Launch type to use
			- EC2
			- Fargate
		- Logging configuration
			- bridge
			- host
			- awsvpc
			- none
		- Volumes that should be mounted
		- Task execution #iam role
- Task placement strategies [ðŸ”—](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/amazon-ecs-task-placement/)
	- **binpack**
		- Places tasks on a few instaces as possible.
		- Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use.
	- **random**
		- Place tasks randomly.
		- No config is required
	- **spread**
		- Maximize availability
		- Place tasks evenly based on the specified value. 
		- Accepted values are attribute key-value pairs,Â _instanceId_, orÂ _host_.
