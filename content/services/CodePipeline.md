## CodePipeline Features
- CodePipeline allows you to create a test stage with a test action prior to the deployment stage.

	- Stop and wait
	- Stop and abondon
- A pipeline of workflow is composed of stages.
- Execution modes:
	- ðŸ“Œ `SUPERSEDED` 
	- `QUEUED`
	- `PARALLEL`
- Status:
	- `InProgress`
	- `Stopping`
	- `Stopped`
