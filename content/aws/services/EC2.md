			- [[CloudFormation|AWS CloudFormation]] [üîó](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-ec2fleet.html)
		- Each fleet can be defined in only one region.
	- Metadata
		- üìå The URL is `http://169.254.169.254/latest/`
			- `dynamic`
			- `meta-data/`
				- `ami-id`

				- `ami-manifest-path`
				- `block-device-mapping/`
				- `hostname`
				- `iam/`
					- `security-credentials/`
						- `MyEC2Role`
							- returns short-lived credentials through [[IAM]] role
				- `instance-action`

			- `√πser-data
		- ‚úÖ We can get [[IAM]] #role name
		- ‚ùå We cannot get retrieve [[IAM]] #policy 
- Storage
	- Storage options
		- [[EBS]]
			- Multiple EBS volumes can be attached to an instance.
			- Persists independently from the life of its associated instance.
		- Instance store
			- Temporary block-level storage for instances.
			- The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated instance; if you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, any data on instance store volumes is lost.
		- [[EFS]] 
			- Not support on Windows
			- Use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances.
		- [[S3]]
			- EC2 uses Amazon S3 to store EBS snapshots and instance store-backed AMIs.
		- FSx
			- Amazon FSx is a fully-managed service that supports a wide range of workloads. You can choose between these widely-used file systems: Lustre, NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS, and Windows File Server.
		- Amazon File Cache
			- Fully managed, high-speed #cache on AWS that's used to process file data, regardless of where the data is stored.
	- Root device type
		- `EBS`
		- `INSTANCE-STORE`
	- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
		- Virtualization technology that combines multiple disk drives into a single logical unit to improve performance, redundancy, or both.
		- RAID Levels
			- `RAID 0` (Striping) 
				- Increase performance
			- `RAID 1`(Mirroring)
				- Provides redundancy
			- `RAID 5` (Striping with Parity)
				- Balances performance and redundancy
			- `RAID 10` (RAID 1+0)
				- Combines the benefits of `RAID 0` and `RAID 1`.

## EC2 Auto Scaling [üîó](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html)
- Helps you ensure that you have the correct number of EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.
- The collection of EC2 instances are called Auto Scaling Group.
- Minimum and Maximum number of instances can be defined.
- Multiple #az is available and evenly distributed to them.
- If group includes spot instances, instances are automatically replaced with spot instances.
