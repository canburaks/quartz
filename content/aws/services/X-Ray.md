## X-Ray Features
- X-Ray creates a map of services used by your application with trace data. 
- You can use the trace data to drill into specific services or issues. 
- This data provides a view of connections between services in your application and aggregated data for each service, including average #latency and failure rates.
- Can be used to 
	- Detect bottlenecks
	- Visualize distributed apps
- API
	- `GetTraceSummaries`
		- Get the list of trace IDs of the application.
		- Ä°ncludes `ClientIp`
	- `BatchGetTraces`
		- Retrieve the list of traces.
	- `GetGroup`
		- Retrieves the group resource details.
	- `GetServiceGraph`
		- Shows which services process the incoming requests, including the downstream services that they call as a result.
	- `PutTraceSegments`
		- Send segment documents directly to X-Ray.
- Segments [ðŸ”—](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html)
	- A segment document can be contain 
		- A whole segment with subsegments.
		- A fragment of a segment that indicates that a request is in progress.
		- A single subsegment that is sent separately.
	- Can be up to `64 kB`.
	- A `trace segment` is a JSON representation of a request that your application serves. A trace segment records information about the original request, information about the work that your application does locally, and `subsegments` with information about downstream calls that your application makes to AWS resources, HTTP APIs, and SQL databases.
- X-Ray Daemon
	- Listens for traffic on `UDP` port `2000`
	- Can be run:
		- Locally
		- On-premise
		- On AWS Services
- Annotations
	- Key-value pairs that indexed for use with filter expressions.
	- Use to group traces in the console when calling `GetTraceSummaries`.
- Metadata
	- Key-value pairs that are not indexed for use with filter expressions.
- Error categories
	- Error: Client errors `4xx` 
	- Fault: Server faults `5xx`
	- Throttle: Throttling errors `429`
