## S3 Features
- Filtering objects with prefix and suffix
- [S3 Object Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/object-lambda/)
	- Enables to process data with custom code
	- Use cases: 
		- Redact Persoanlly Identifiable Information (PII)
		- Augment data from other services
		- Watermarking images on the fly
		- Compressing or decompressing files as being downloaded
		- Converting across data formats
- Storage Classes
	- Standard
	- Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
		- Minimum `30 days` charge
	- One Zone-Infrequent Access (99.5 Availability)
	- Intelligent Tiering
	- Glacier Instant Retrieval (Minimum `90 days` charge)
		- Long-lived data
		- Retrieval in `miliseconds`
		- Suitable for accessing a few times in a year.
	- Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Minimum `90 days` charge)
		- Long-term data
		- Retrieval in `minutes` to `hours`
		- Types of Archive Retrievals
			- Standard 
							- Retrieval: `3 - 5 hours`
			- Expedited
				- Urgent case
				- Expensive
				- Retrieval: `1 - 5 minutes`
				- Can not exceed `250 MB`
			- Bulk
				- Free
				- Retrieval: `5 - 12 hours`
	- Glacier Deep Archive (Minimum `180 days` charge)
		- The cheapest
		- Suitable for long retention periods, like 10 years
		- Types of Archive Retrievals
			- Standard
				- Retrieval: `12 hours`
			- Extended/Bulk
				- Retrieval: `48 hours`
- Encryption types
	- SSE-KMS
		- Enforce `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header with `aws:kms` value.
		- Can be encrypted with 
			- AWS-managed KMSkey
			- Customer-managed KMS key
				- Add `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` policies
	- SSE-S3
		- Denies with requests that do not include `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header with `AES256` as the value.
	- SSE-C (Customer-provided enc key)
		- Only accepts `AES-256`
		- Enc key must be provided along with the data
		- Reject `HTTP` requests
		- headers must include one of them
			- ` x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm‬`
			- ` x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
			- ` x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5‬`
	- Client-side Encryption
		- Client is responsible for encryption/decryption
