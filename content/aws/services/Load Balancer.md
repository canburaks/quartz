## Load Balancer Features
- Load Balancers
	- Application Load Balancer
		- Allows to select up to 5 #security-group .
		- AWS assigned #ip address.
		- Can be target [[Lambda]] in `Target Group` section.
		- Allows `multi-value headers`.
			- E.g. for query string `?name=foo&name=bar`
				- It returns `‘name’: [‘foo’, ‘bar’]`
		- Protocols
			- ✅ `HTTP` (HyperText Transfer Protocol):
				- Supports standard web traffic over port 80.
				- Commonly used for serving web content, APIs, and other HTTP traffic.
			- ✅ `HTTPS` (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):
				- Supports secure web traffic over port 443 using SSL/TLS encryption.
				- Used for secure websites, APIs, and other encrypted communications.
			- ✅ `WebSocket`:
				- Supports full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
				- Useful for real-time applications such as chat applications, live data feeds, etc.
				- Works over both HTTP and HTTPS.
			- ❌`UDP` (User Datagram Protocol):
				- Not supported by Application Load Balancers. UDP is typically used for low-latency and loss-tolerant connections, such as DNS, video streaming, and online gaming.
	- Network Load Balancer
		- AWS assigned #ip address and Elastic #ip address
		- Protocols
			- ✅`TCP` (Transmission Control Protocol): 
				- NLB supports TCP traffic, making it suitable for applications that require reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
			- ✅`UDP` (User Datagram Protocol):
				- NLB supports UDP traffic, which is ideal for applications that require low-latency, connectionless communication, such as #dns queries, video streaming, and online gaming.
