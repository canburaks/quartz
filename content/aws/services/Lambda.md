### Example CLI Invocation
#### Synchronous Invocation
```shell
aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name testFunction \
    --invocation-type RequestResponse \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --payload '{"input": "input_value"}' response.json
```

#### Asynchronous Invocation
```shell
 aws lambda invoke \
--function-name testFunction \
--invocation-type Event \
--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
--payload '{"input":"input_value"}' response.json

```

### Event source mappings
An event source mapping is a sort of polling agent that Lambda manages.
- Invokes a lambda function synchronously if:
	- The batch size is reached
	- The maximum batching window is reached

---
## Deployment
- You can upload a zip file directly to the console
- You can upload a zip file to [[S3]], and Lambda can download it from there
- You can paste code directly to the console


## Deploying Code with External Dependencies
- üçÇ Zip the local code and deploy to AWS Lambda
	- Deploying multiple Lambda functions that have the same dependencies is inefficient
	- Steps
		- Install all external dependencies
		- Create a deployment package in `zip` format.
		- Upload to AWS Lambda
- üçÉ Lambda Layers
	- Lambda Layers lets you store any additional code separately from your deployment package
	- Lambda layers can be shared among Lambda functions
	- Like a deployment package, external dependencies must be in zip format before being uploaded to AWS Lambda

## Concurrency and Throttling
- `1000 unreserved` concurrent executions across all Lambda functions for every region per account. (Can be increased by contacting AWS Support)
- When distributing concurrencies, `unreserved count` can not be less than `100`. In other words, `reserved concurrent execution` is limited to `900`.  
- Returns `429` #http-status-code
	- A function reaches its `reserved conccurrency` limit
	- A function reaches `unreserved concurrency` limit of the account  
	- When computing #concurrency limit for a Lambda function consider:
		- Execution time
		- Number of requests handled per second
		- Calculations differ for Poll-based event sources and push-based

### Example Scenario
Lambda function
- processes HTTP requests from API Gateway with unreserved concurrency
- Expects an average execution time of 10 seconds
- Expects 150 requests per second.
At is can be seen from below, after 6th second, many requests will sart to fail.

| Second    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Request   | 150 | 150 | 150 | 150 | 150 | 150 | 150  | 150  | 150  | 10   |
| Functions | 150 | 300 | 450 | 600 | 750 | 900 | 1050 | 1200 | 1350 | 1500 |

## Connections to a VPC
- Lambda functions live in an isolated and secured VPC managed by AWS
- Lambda function can interact with resources inside a private subnet by
	- Should have `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` permission (creation and deletion of `Elastic Network Interface`)
- Even if Lambda function is connected to public subnet, #vpc still be unable to route traffic between Lambda function and the internet. To fix this:
	- Create a `NAT Gateway` in `public subnet` in the `VPC`
	- Add entry to `private subnet`'s `route table`.
		- Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
		- Target: `NAT Gateway`

## Version and Aliases [üîó](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
- AWS Lambda assigns version numbers monotonically which means version number always increases even if it is deleted.
- Unpublished version is referred as `$LATEST`.
- Function uses `$LATEST` if the version is not specified.
- When you publish a new version, a `:version-number` suffix is appended to your function‚Äôs #arn, which indicates its version, (`1`)  
	- `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789123:function:cool-function‚Ä¨‚Ä≠:1‚Ä¨`
- Invoke a function with an #alias is possible.
	- Append `:alias-name` suffix to the function #arn
	- Every #alias has its own unique #arn
